# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair programming project made by Rosanna Dahlberg and Maria Thomasson.

In this week's project we built a game which allows the user to navigate a maze in the form of a text-based adventure, provided by a backend.

We used an API specified to build a frontend which gives the user control over what to do next. We focused on using thunks and redux to build the communication with the backend.
